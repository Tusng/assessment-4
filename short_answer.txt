1) What is the difference between a client and a server? In the HTTP protocol,
which one of these sends requests, and which one sends responses?
_Client is the requester, who sends request to a server and expect a response back. 
_On the other hand, server is the responder, which receives a request from a client and give back a response based on the request.

2) What do we mean by a "route" on a server?
_Route on a server is the endpoint of a URL, which is used to identify what kind of request it is for a corresponding response.
